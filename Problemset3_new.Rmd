abstract: "Education is a contributor to many beneficial socio-economic outcomes. We intend to exam the the relationship between academic majors and household income in Toronto's neighbourhoods—can we find higher or lower percentage population in certain academic majors in higher or lower income neighbourhoods? The result shows that higher income neighbourhoods also have higher percentage of residents with majors in business, The data set is retrieved from the package *City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles* from the year 2016. ###### We intend to use the comparison to bring awareness of inequality in income and education existing in the City of Toronto."

# Introduction
Education is a contributor to many beneficial socio-economic outcomes. In this study, we intend to examine the relationship between household income and educational profile in terms of residents' academic majors in Toronto's 140 neighbourhoods. The majors are categorized as follows—
"education", "visual and performing arts and communications technologies," "humanities," "social and behavioural sciences and law," "business_management_and_public_administration," "physical and life sciences and technologies," "mathematics computer and information sciences," "architecture engineering and related technologies," "agriculture natural resources and conservation," "personal protective and transportation services" and "no postsecondary certificate diploma or degree." The question we want to answer is if we can find a higher population percentage in specific academic majors in higher-income neighbourhoods or vice versa? The question is relevant because the academic major is a significant factor for people's occupations and their associated earning; thus, it is deemed as an essential tool for social mobility.

# Dataset and Method Description
City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles data set is sourced from several Census tables released by Statistics Canada every five years. The dataset uses this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. Each data point in this file is presented for the City's 140 neighbourhoods, as well as for the City of Toronto as a whole. The data set consists of 144 columns for neighbourhoods and 1537 rows for characteristics of the neighbourhoods. Data cleaning and reshaping are performed to have a new data frame that has 14 characteristics regarding topics of income as columns and education and the 140 neighbourhoods as rows.ing among academic fields.
